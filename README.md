# Hello World (Beginner)

How to get started in C as fast as possible.

## What is `Hello World` project is all about?

This repository is meant to include short codes with enough explanations to help readers to get started in `C` following idiomatic and standard way of thinking in `C` but without complicated and "too much" opinionated design decisions.

**NOTE: For now there is no build system and no `Makefile` just one file examples**

## Setup the compiler

Actually there are lots and lots of materials on this pretty much everywhere, and I think if you're here you probably have it already installed right now, but there are some rule of thumbs though:

what I will go through is just command line compilations using `gcc`/`clang` style command argument in `POSIX` operating systems so feel free to search and find proper resources if you're using `CLion` or `Visual Studio 2022`.

### An alternative

`Zig` programming language compiler can really be used as a quick "just download and unzip" drop-in compiler.

you can get it from [here](https://ziglang.org/learn/getting-started/#installing-zig), all you need is to install it and add it to your system path. you can even use it by relatively run it in command line like `../../zig/zig cc ....`. you get the idea.
